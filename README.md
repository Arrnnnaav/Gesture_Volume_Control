#  Hand Gesture Volume Control using OpenCV, MediaPipe & Pycaw

This Python project allows you to **control system volume using hand gestures** detected via a webcam.  
It uses **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking and **Pycaw** to interface with the system’s audio controls.

##  Features

-  Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
-  Detects thumb and index finger positions to control volume
-  Dynamically visualized volume bar and percentage on screen
-  Maps hand distance to system volume using Pycaw
-  Smooth and intuitive gesture-based volume control

##  Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- `OpenCV` – for webcam video capture and visualization
- `MediaPipe` – for detecting and tracking hand landmarks
- `Pycaw` – to control system volume on Windows
- `NumPy` – for interpolating distance to volume mapping
